The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health indicators. To achieve this, three different classification models—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression—are trained and evaluated. Instead of selecting a single model outright, the project compares their accuracy and identifies the best-performing classifier.

The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature scaling using StandardScaler, and splitting into training and testing sets. Each model is trained separately and evaluated based on its performance metrics, particularly accuracy, precision, and recall.

A single input prompt allows users to enter relevant health indicators, which the trained models analyze to provide a prediction on whether the person is diabetic. The best-performing model is then used for final decision-making, ensuring higher accuracy and reliability in diagnosis.

This project highlights the potential of AI in healthcare, providing a fast, data-driven approach to diabetes prediction. By leveraging machine learning, it aids in early detection, which is crucial for timely medical intervention and better patient outcomes.
